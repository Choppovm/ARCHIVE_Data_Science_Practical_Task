# Data Science Practical Task

A while back, I started a taught course on data science provided by MEI.

I've now reached the end of this course. The end consists of two parts: the practical task, and the practical assessment.

This repository is that practical task.

A few things to be noted:
- This is an ARCHIVE, not a project. This won't be updated for any reason.
- If variable names look off, it's due to the libraries being used forcing me to use a different format to the one I'm used to.
- This was done in Kaggle Notebook

ok thats all
